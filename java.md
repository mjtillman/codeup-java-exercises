## Variables in Java

####Variable names

- start with a letter, _, or $
- contain letters, $, _, numbers
- Must be under 255 characters

*Recommended*
- start with lowercase letter
- use camel case

#### Strong Typing

Every variable must have a type specified:

**Letters:**

`char foo = 'Q';`

Must use single quotes for chars.

**Numbers:**

To make variables constant:

    final double pi = 3.14

Whole numbers only:

`byte`

`int zion = 21;`

`short`

`long`

Decimals:

`float`

`double`

**Other:**

`boolean likesIceCream = true;`

`reference`
        
A string is an object in Java.

Assigning a value other than the initially declared type will not work in Java.
